#What?
Lightweight implementation for Levenshtein distance calculation.

#Why?
Just another lightweight implementation with benchmarks, covered by unit tests & with ES2015 features usage.

#Start
`npm install`

#Tests
Run `npm test`, or with watch `npm run test-w`

#Benchmarks
Tests performed on:
`MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)
2,7 GHz Intel Core i5
8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3`

Result: `getDistance x 1,001,512 ops/sec ±8.55% (73 runs sampled)`

#Roadmap
- add transpilation step to support older browsers.
